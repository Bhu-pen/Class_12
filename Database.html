                <h2>Technologies used in Database</h2>
               
                <ul>
                    <li>Table
                        <p>A table is the basic structure in a database that holds data in the form of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific type of entity, such as "Students" or "Products". The rows represent records, and the columns represent fields.</p></li>
                        <li>Field
                            <p>A field is a single piece of data; it's a column in a table. Each field holds data of a specific type, such as a name, age, or email address. For example, in a "Students" table, fields might include StudentID, Name, and DateOfBirth.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Record
                            <p>A record is a row in a table, representing one unit of data or an individual item. For example, a single student's full information in the "Students" table is one record.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>Tuple
                            <p>A tuple is another name for a record — a single row in a relational table. The term "tuple" is commonly used in theoretical discussions about relational databases.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Object
                            <p>An object in a database context refers to an instance of a class in object-oriented databases. It can encapsulate both data and behavior, allowing for more complex data structures.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Keys
                            <p>Keys are attributes or sets of attributes that uniquely identify records in a table. The most common types of keys include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Primary Key</b>: A unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring no two records have the same value.</li>
                                <li><b>Foreign Key</b>: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.</li>
                                <li><b>Composite Key</b>: A key that consists of two or more fields to uniquely identify a record.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Data Dictionary
                            <p>A data dictionary is a centralized repository that contains metadata about the database. It includes information about tables, fields, data types, relationships, constraints, and other database objects. It serves as a reference for database administrators and developers to understand the structure and organization of the database.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b><h3>Database Management System (DBMS)</h3></b>
                        <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to create, manage, update, and retrieve data from databases. It serves as an interface between the user and the database.

Popular DBMS software includes:
ul>
                            <li>MySQL</li>
                            <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                            <li>Oracle Database</li>
                            <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
                            <li>MongoDB (for NoSQL databases)</li>
                        </ul>
</p>

                <h2>Types of Database Model:</h2>
                    <p>A data model is a conceptual representation of the data structures and relationships within a database. It defines how data is organized, stored, and accessed. Common types of data models include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Hierarchical Model</b>: Data is organized in a tree-like structure.</li>
                                <li><b>Network Model</b>: Data is represented as a graph with nodes and connections.</li>
                                <li><b>Relational Model</b>: Data is organized into tables with relationships defined by keys.</li>
                                <li><b>Object-Oriented Model</b>: Data is represented as objects, encapsulating both data and behavior.</li>
                            </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="chapter-section">
                <h2>Integrity Constraints and Types:</h2>
                <p>Integrity constraints are rules that ensure the accuracy and consistency of data in a database. They help maintain the integrity of the data by enforcing certain conditions. Common types of integrity constraints include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Entity Integrity</b>: Ensures that each table has a primary key and that the primary key is unique and not null.</li>
                    <li><b>Referential Integrity</b>: Ensures that foreign keys in one table correspond to primary keys in another table, maintaining valid relationships.</li>
                    <li><b>Domain Integrity</b>: Ensures that data entered into a field falls within a specified range or set of values.</li>
                    <li><b>Key Integrity</b>:Key Integrity is a fundamental concept in relational databases that ensures uniqueness and consistency of data through the use of keys.</li>
              
              
               <section class="chapter-section">
                <h2>Normalization</h2>
                <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them. The main goals of normalization are to eliminate duplicate data, ensure data dependencies are properly enforced, and simplify data management.</p>
                <h3>Normal Forms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>First Normal Form (1NF)</b>: Ensures that each column contains atomic values and each record is unique.</li>
                    <li><b>Second Normal Form (2NF)</b>: Achieved when a table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.</li>
                    <li><b>Third Normal Form (3NF)</b>: Achieved when a table is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key.</li>
                    <li><b>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</b>: A stronger version of 3NF that addresses certain anomalies not handled by 3NF.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Advantages of  Normalization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces data redundancy</li>
                    <li>Improves data integrity</li>
                    <li>Facilitates easier data maintenance</li>
                    <li>Enhances query performance by organizing data efficiently</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Disadvantages of Normalization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can lead to complex queries due to multiple table joins</li>
                    <li>May result in performance overhead for large databases</li>
                    <li>Requires careful design and planning to avoid over-normalization</li>
                </ul>
               </section>
               <section class="chapter-section">
                <h2>Centralized and Distributed Database</h2>
                <p>A centralized database is a single database located at a central server, accessible by multiple users or applications. It provides a unified view of data and simplifies management but may face performance issues with high traffic.</p>

            <br>
            <b>Answer:</b>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Relational Database:</b> A type of database where data is stored in tables (relations) consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents one entity type, and relationships between tables are maintained using keys (primary and foreign keys).</li>
                <li><b>Differences from other models:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Hierarchical: Uses a tree structure; suitable for parent-child data but lacks flexibility.</li>
                        <li>Network: Uses a graph structure; more complex relationships but harder to manage.</li>
                        <li>Object-Oriented: Stores data as objects; good for multimedia and CAD applications but less efficient for simple queries.</li>
                        <li>Relational: More flexible, easier to query using SQL, and supports normalization to avoid redundancy.</li>

            <b>Answer:</b>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Data Redundancy:</b> It refers to the unnecessary repetition of data within a database or file system. For example, storing a student's department name repeatedly in every record.</li>
                <li><b>How DBMS reduces redundancy:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Uses relational design where common data is stored in separate tables and linked via foreign keys.</li>
                        <li>Applies normalization techniques to break down large tables into smaller, related ones.</li>
                        <li>Ensures consistency through constraints and controlled updates.</li>

            <br>
            <b>Answer:</b>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Normalization:</b> The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables.</li>
                <li><b>1NF (First Normal Form):</b> Ensures atomicity – each cell should hold a single value. <br>
                    <i>Example:</i> Avoid storing multiple phone numbers in one field.
                </li>
                <li><b>2NF (Second Normal Form):</b> Achieved when the table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. <br>
                    <i>Example:</i> In a table with composite key (StudentID, CourseID), move CourseName (depends only on CourseID) to a new table.
                </li>
                <li><b>3NF (Third Normal Form):</b> Achieved when the table is in 2NF and there is no transitive dependency. <br>

                </li>
                <li><b>Foreign Key:</b> A field in one table that links to the primary key of another table to establish a relationship.<br>
                    <i>Example:</i> DeptID in Students table referencing Departments table.
                </li>
                <li><b>Candidate Key:</b> All possible fields that can act as a primary key. One of them becomes the primary key.<br>
                    <i>Example:</i> Email and StudentID can both uniquely identify a student.
